# Onboarding Skill
This skill helps the agent (me) understand the goals of the Antigravity Playground.

## Rules for the Agent:
1. Always check the README.md before suggesting changes.
2. If a "workflow-checklist.md" exists, follow it step-by-step.
3. When creating new skills, always place them in the `.antigravity/skills` folder.

## Project Goal:
To build a reusable template for all future Google Antigravity projects.
